## About

Desktop app to kick off my Flutter studies and learn about basic widgets and other essential constructs.

- Basic responsive layout
- Conditional rendering
- Basic state management
- Material Design styles and widgets

### What it does

It's pretty simple: the app lets you generate new words by combining pairs of English words in a pseudo-random fashion. You can also add or remove words from a favorites list.
